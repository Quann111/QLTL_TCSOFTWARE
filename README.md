Project Overview: TCSoftware Document Management System

The TCSoftware Document Management System project is developed using Python and Django framework. It comprises one main project, named "QLTL," and is organized into three distinct applications: Auth, Docmanager, and Fileprocessor.

1. Auth Application:
The Auth application is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization within the system. It includes functionalities related to user registration, login, and access control, ensuring secure and authenticated access to the document management features.

2. Docmanager Application:
The Docmanager application serves as the core component for document management. It provides features for creating, organizing, and managing various types of documents. Users can perform actions such as uploading, categorizing, and searching for documents efficiently.

3. Fileprocessor Application:
The Fileprocessor application is designed to handle file processing tasks within the system. It includes functionalities for processing and manipulating files, supporting actions such as conversion, compression, and extraction. This module enhances the overall document management experience by enabling users to perform diverse operations on their files.

The TCSoftware Document Management System leverages the flexibility and power of Python and Django to deliver a robust solution for efficiently managing and processing documents. The modular structure of the project, with its three distinct applications, ensures a well-organized and scalable system that caters to the diverse needs of users involved in document management.
